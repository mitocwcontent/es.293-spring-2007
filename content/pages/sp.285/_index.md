This page is an archive of another ESG course that spun off from SP.293 in Spring and Fall '99, SP.285 Robotics and Mechatronics Projects. Similar in format, with fairly open-ended teaching sessions and several projects, it emphasized electronics and mechanical construction skills, in addition to the Lego robotics topics.

Lecture Topics
--------------

*   Sensors + Actuators and Printer Disassembly
*   Abstraction, Writing control psuedocode for the printers
*   Discussing examples of Good Design and Bad Design
*   Feedback and Control Systems
*   Mechanical Transmissions
*   Control and Programming Case Study: The wall-following car
*   Project 2 conclusion, demonstrations
*   Lego gear and geartrain physics
*   Mechanisms
*   Methods of Manufacturing and Mass Production
*   Estimation and Getting a Feel for Measurements
*   The one-day Electronics class
